## K-Ruler Setup
K-Ruler tells you precisely where your objects are in relation to each other.

K-Ruler displays on screen a ruler measuring pixels. Position the 0 to your starting point (simple drag it), and read off the precise pixel count to your cursor. To change the length of the ruler just drag the sides.

```bash
sudo apt-get install kruler
```
## Inkscape Setup
Inkscape is an open-source vector graphics editor similar to Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw, Freehand, or Xara X. What sets Inkscape apart is its use of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), an open XML-based W3C standard, as the native format.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:inkscape.dev/stable
```

```bash
sudo apt update
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install inkscape

```
