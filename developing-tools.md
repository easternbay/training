## K-Ruler Setup
K-Ruler tells you precisely where your objects are in relation to each other.

K-Ruler displays on screen a ruler measuring pixels. Position the 0 to your starting point (simple drag it), and read off the precise pixel count to your cursor. To change the length of the ruler just drag the sides.

```bash
sudo apt-get install kruler
```
